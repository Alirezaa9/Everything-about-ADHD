            <h2>Meet my friend Zippy with ADHD</h2>
            <p>
                Meet Zippy, the superhero with ADHD! Zippy's superpower is "Hyperfocus Laser Vision," making them
                awesome at diving deep into things they love. But watch out for Distracto, the mischievous sidekick who
                throws shiny distractions. Zippy's brain is like a bustling amusement park where all the rides are open
                at once.
                <br>
                <br>
                To keep Distracto in check, Zippy uses fidget spinners and breaks tasks into smaller chunks. ADHD is
                just one part of Zippy's unique and dynamic personality. So, hop on the adventure, embrace the energy,
                and enjoy the bursts of creativity that come with having a brain wired a little differently!

                Zippy, our ADHD superhero, navigates daily tasks with bursts of energy, excelling in "Hyperfocus Laser
                Vision" mode. Communication is a dynamic dance, valuing openness amidst occasional distractions.

                Sensitivity to rejection prompts a quest for validation, met with resilience strategies. In Zippy's
                daily rhythm, challenges become opportunities, and each day is an adventure filled with enthusiasm and
                ingenuity.

                <p>
                    Zippy approaches task management with bursts of energy. They might struggle with starting tasks but
                    excel when they enter "Hyperfocus Laser Vision" mode. To tackle this, Zippy uses tools like timers
                    or breaks tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. While the to-do list may be an ever-evolving
                    adventure, Zippy navigates it with creativity and resilience.

            <h2>Communication</h2>
            <p>
                Zippy is a social butterfly but can sometimes get caught in the web of distractions. They've learned to
                use active listening and might doodle or fidget during conversations to stay engaged. Zippy values open
                communication and appreciates when others understand their dynamic thought process.

            <h2>Perfectionism</h2>
            <p>
                Zippy dances with perfectionism, wanting to excel in everything they do. They've learned that perfection
                is a journey, not a destination, and strive for progress over perfection. Zippy's quirks and unique
                approaches often lead to innovative solutions and unexpected successes.

            <h2>Rejection Sensitivity</h2>
            <p>
                Zippy, being sensitive to rejection, seeks validation and positive feedback. Constructive criticism can
                be challenging, so Zippy has developed coping strategies like reframing feedback as an opportunity for
                growth. Surrounding themselves with a supportive network helps Zippy navigate the emotional
                rollercoaster of rejection sensitivity.
